# Downloading: 
Look for [BlowTorch MUD Client](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.happygoatstudios.bt) on the Google Play store.

# Basic Setup:
![Basic Blowtorch interface](assets/interface_1.jpg)
Above: the base Blowtorch interface. On my devices, the three buttons were all greyed out. The leftmost is 'New,' the middle is 'Help,' and the one on the right is 'Donate.'


![Connection Properties](assets/interface_2.jpg)
Clicking on 'New' will bring up a screen to add connection properties. These have been populated with our connection details.


![Default settings](assets/interface_3_settings.jpg)
By default, the text is very large. You can click on the three dots in the upper right to access the menu, then 'settings'.


![Settings screen](assets/interface_4_window_settings.jpg)
In the settings screen, scroll down to 'Window'.


![Font Size](assets/interface_5_font_size.jpg)
The default font size is ridiculous. I usually turn it down to ~15.


![Logged in!](assets/interface_6_logged_in.jpg)
An example of logging in, with a stray 'button' in the middle of the screen. We'll handle those on the '[buttons](BlowToch Button Configuration)' page.


![Buttons configured!](assets/interface_9_button_set.jpg)
An example of the connection after configuring buttons using the settings on the buttons page.
