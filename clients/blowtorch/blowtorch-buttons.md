Note: This only covers basic button setup.

As BlowTorch is meant for use on a phone or tablet, the lack of a keyboard can become a disadvantage. To counter this, BlowTorch allows you to define button sets, though you can only have one button set active at a time.
To work with Button Sets, tap the three dots in the upper right, then select 'Button Sets'. This will bring up a list of your saved button sets, and allow you to select one for use. You will need to click on the button set, then the refresh icon. This will disable other button sets and enable the selected.

To edit a button set, click on it from the Button Sets menu, then click the gear icon. This will bring up a grid where you can select any location to create, edit, move, or delete buttons. To create a button, tap a location on the grid, hit 'edit', and you can set both the label and the command. A common setup would be to add numpad-style movement buttons, which are included in the [assets/sentience.xml](sentience.xml) file if you just want to download that and import settings in the client. When editing a button, the 'advanced' tab also provides a way to change the colour of the button. In my default settings file, I changed 'who' to red.
