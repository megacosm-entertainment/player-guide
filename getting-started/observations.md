Initial room has a parchment scroll that tells you how you can move. There is nothing to indicate how to look at the scroll. `look at scroll`. Someone new to muds may be entirely stuck here, frustrated.

Hints channel begins spamming you immediately. 'channels' lists a number of things that are also covered by the toggle menu, and do not necessarily have easy ways to toggle on and off from here if you did not know about the `toggle` command.

toggle afk seems superfluous, as 'afk' also exists, and allows you to set an afk message. Remove this toggle?

In channels, notify, quiet, battle spam, and form state are all covered by the toggle menu. Battle spam cannot be toggled via channel command. Form state is not a channel. Remove notify, battle spam, and form state from `channels`?

Prompt could maybe go on `prompt` command if no argument given, and the on/off for showing it require `toggle prompt`
