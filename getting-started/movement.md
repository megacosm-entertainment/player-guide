# Getting around
---
When traveling the world of Sentience, you will typically be moving one location at a time. This is generally done via directional commands (North, East, West, Up, Down, etc), though there are some exceptions. At any time, you can refer to the compass on the right edge of the screen (above the room description, right of the room name) to see what exits are currently visible to you.

## Doors
From time to time, you will come across doors that bar your path. You can attempt to open a door with `open <direction>` and will open it if possible. Sometimes, however, doors may be locked. In this case, you will need to either find a key, attempt to `bash <direction>` to get through, or use the 'pass door' spell. Some doors are protected against these methods, so if you are unsure, you should begin looking for a key.

## Locks
When a door is locked and you have no other way through, you may attempt to `pick <direction>` to try picking the lock. Not all doors can be picked, but for thieves, this may be a good way to get through.

## Portals and Ships
Portals appear in many places throughout the game. They will show up as objects in a room, and can be interacted with like any other object. Additionally, you can `enter <portal>` to travel through it.

## Mounts
Traveling may tire you out, as every step and every round of combat will drain your movement. To avoid prolonging your adventures in the wilderness, you can seek out shops that provide mounts (or steal one from the locals). Using `mount <npc>` will let you ride them, and movement will drain from the mount instead of from you.

## The Wilderness
Outside of the cities, there lies a vast wilderness. In many places there are roads between the towns, but the journeys may be long and difficult.

## Ships
At one time, ships sailed the seas of Sentience, and the inventive Goblins even had vessels that could travel the skies. Unfortunately those days are no more. While efforts have been made to rediscover sailing and flying technology, we're not quite there yet.
