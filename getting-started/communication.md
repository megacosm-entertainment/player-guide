# Talking to Others

---

Sentience is a multiplayer game at its heart, and as such, there are multiple channels of communication. You may see the available channels at any time using the `channels` command.

For most of these, you can turn them on or off simply by entering the channel name with nothing else. Some are local, while others will be heard across the entire zone, or game.

|channel | scope | example |
|:-------|:------|:--------|
| say | room | say This is a test. |
| whisper | single target (same room) | whisper `<name>` This is a test. |
| tell | single target (global) | tell `<name>` You smell! |
| reply | single target (global) | reply No you! |
| yell | area | yell This zone is awesome! |
| music | global | music You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave |
| gossip | global | gossip I love this game! |
| ooc | global | ooc My computer exploded! |
| flaming | global | flaming The imms are dumb! |
| quotes | global | quote Fool me once, strike one. Fool me twice, strike three. - Michael Scott |
| helper | helpers and staff | helper I've fallen and I can't get up |
| war | unused | Please don't use this |
| announcements | special | `This is a read-only channel for system announcements` |

## Some time to yourself
If you ever want to focus on your leveling, you can also toggle `quiet` mode on. Quiet will turn off all channels, except for tells from players you have explicitly allowed. You can use the `qlist <name>` command to add or remove specific players from your quiet list.

## Stepping away
If you need to step away and wish to indicate that to other players, you can use `afk <reason>`. This will prevent tells from showing up on your screen while away, and will show your reason to the person trying to reach you. You can type `afk` again to return, and `replay` to play back any tells you may have missed.

## Will you shut up, man?
If another player has upset you to the point that you do not wish to talk to them, you can `ignore <player> [reason]`. Be aware that they will be shown the reason if they try to send you a tell.
