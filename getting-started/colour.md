# The colours, Duke! The colours!@
Sentience supports 16 colours by default. An extended range is partially implemented, but may still be buggy at this time. Please review `help colour` for further information, but know that the colour codes starting with `{` are the 'classic' colours and known to be safe for use around the game.
