When you first connect to [telnet://sentiencemud.net:9000](SentienceMUD), you will be greeted with our splash screen and a prompt to provide a character name. If you already have a character, provide the password and you should be in! 

{: info}
If you need help resetting your password, please reach out to Tieryo on our [https://discord.gg/E2Ahw5Xy]Discord server, or Ryan Hanson on facebook, or as a last resort, [mailto:tieryo@sentiencemud.net](tieryo@sentiencemud.net).

If you are new to the game, or returning and wish to create a new character for a fresh start, read on:

The first thing you will need to do is confirm you want to start a new character with your chosen name, set a password, and provide your email address. While email is not currently used by any ingame system, it will help with making password resets easier.
