# Currencies
There are a number of ways to get ahead in Sentience, but each of them will cost you. To pay your way in the world, there are several currencies available.

- Silver and Gold
  The most common currencies, used in the vast majority of shops. Be aware that coins have weight. You will want to visit banks periodically to drop off your filthy lucre.
- Deity Points (or Karma)
  For every creature you kill in the world, they may leave behind a corpse or some of their belongings. The gods, however, demand eternal tribute. You may `sacrifice` items (such as gems, weapons, enemy corpses, and so on) to earn deity points. Should your luck run out and you fall in battle or to misadventure, you may attempt to locate the warlock, Geldoff, who will restore you to life for some of your precious deity points.
  {: .note}
  Returning to life via Geldoff will cost (current level * 250) deity points, and return you to the 'recall' room of the zone where you died. Hopefully this will be safe!
- Quest Points
  Quest masters across the realm will provide you with tasks to perform, and provide you with quest points in return. These quest masters also typically stock goods that can be bought for their precious quest points. Quite a racket they're running.
- Pneuma
  Everyone has to grow up at some point. Sentience offers multiclassing every 30 levels. At level 30, it will be time to select a new class (and subclass) to continue progressing through the game. At levels 60 and 90, however, multiclassing will cost 'Pneuma'. This elusive currency comes from braving the Pyramid of the Abyss and slaughtering the demons within to gain bottled souls, which can be traded to either Sir Albert Stiener or Ravage in the city of Plith at a rate of 1 soul per pneuma.

The list above simply covers the most common currencies, and their most common uses. There may be others that you encounter during play, so keep an eye out!
