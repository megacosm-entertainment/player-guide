Mages lead a life devoted to the inner flow of energy within all living things, called mana by most. The vast majority of their powers come from tapping the core of energy within themselves; a mage's true skill comes not from the rote memorization and reciting of spells, but instead from his or her ability to reach this energy. Mages deal with all areas of offensive magic, as they emerged from a warrior class who realized that only brute force would not conquer an enemy with supernatural powers. However, mages alone are quite poor at fighting hand-to-hand; they generally wield daggers in a single hand for defense from petty opponents, and reserve their magic for use against the truly powerful enemies.
