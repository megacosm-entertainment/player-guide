The Illusionists are mages whose magic deals mainly with the intent of making the unreal seem real.  They are no mere tricksters, however, as they can make the night turn to day and vice versa, often using their powerful spells to their personal gain.  The most powerful illusionists of the past have been known to make castles disappear and turn dragons to stone, only to take off and never be seen again.
