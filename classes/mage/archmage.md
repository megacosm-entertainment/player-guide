The Archmages are masters of sheer magical energy and self-control.  They have in their arsenal some of the most powerful spells ever unleashed on mankind, and can level a mountain by unleashing the full might of their potential.  In war, an Archmage is an invaluable ally to have as they can twist the sands of time and unmake existence through their inner power.
