Sorcerers are magicians study the the natural flow of mana within living beings. They can, with difficulty, influence other people through their flow of mana, and can even channel another being's mana into themselves, revitalizing their magical abilities. Sorcerers, unlike wizards, have never identified themselves with either side of the great conflict, saying that the only true endeavour is knowledge.
