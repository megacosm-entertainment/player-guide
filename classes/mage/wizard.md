Wizards are arbiters of morality, and have throughout millenia used their magic to preserve life, and to avoid rule, for they believe power is the ultimate corruptor. They are guardians of truth and can call upon incredible magic power to sweep evil from the land; their just order has helped preserve magic where it would otherwise have died out long ago.
