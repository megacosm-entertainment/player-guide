Marauders are vicious bloodthirsty warriors who delight in nothing so much as the glory of battle. They often fight with no regard for their own well-being and are feared on every battlefield. A charge by a van of marauders is a terrifying sight to behold; they cannot be reasoned with in the midst of their fury.
