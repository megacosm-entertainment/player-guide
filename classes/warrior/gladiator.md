Gladiators are true masters of combat. They dedicate their lives to being the best warriors alive with any weapon. Although they don't have the ferocity of marauders or the devotion and magical powers of a paladin, they are feared and respected due to their strategy and weapon skill. Gladiators spend their lives studying combat strategy and tactics; they learn to outwit their opponents and fight against innumerable odds.
