A Warlord is a master of leadership and cunning battle strategy, with the smarts and skills to lay waste to an entire army.  They are few and far between, often recruited for huge amounts of pay to defend small townes from attack.  Warlord-led formations have routed huge armies while vastly outnumbered, and they are known to well love the challenge of defeating an enemy using tactics rather than brute strength.
