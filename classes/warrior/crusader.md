Crusaders are travelling warriors, most often hired as bounty hunters or city governments to take on quests of incredible magnitude.  They have an apt taste for questing and roaming the lands, often preferring the company of a mount to that of a human being.  Crusaders have many a tale to tell of their exploits and the dangers they have been in, and love the wilderness like a second home.
