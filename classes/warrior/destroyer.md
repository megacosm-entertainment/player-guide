Whereas warlords fight by tact and brains, Destroyers fight by brute force and sheer power.  They are far more feared on the battlefield than any other warrior, and the sound of their powerful battle cries is enough to make battle-hardened men cower in fear.  They take no quarter, demolishing all, and lay waste to the lands of their enemies.
