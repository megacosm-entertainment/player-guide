The paladin is a holy crusader whose powers are closely tied to those of the gods. Due to this they are the only warriors who can perform small amounts of magic, mainly healing and curative spells. Paladins are more proficient at using long-range weapons and fighting with a shield; they are very efficient, organized fighters, depending on both their strength and the strength of their god to give them victory in battle. They are also extremely intelligent, playing games of strategy and reading books of famous conquests and defeats from the first day of their training.
