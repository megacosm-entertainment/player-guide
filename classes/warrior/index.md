Warriors surpass all other classes in fighting, whether it be hand to hand or with a weapon. They are masters of discipline and self-control, and their tolerance for pain and great stamina are unsurpassed. Nothing intimidates an enemy like the approach of a fully-armored warrior ready to do battle; they have nearly all the skills necesarry to win a fight, even against great odds.
