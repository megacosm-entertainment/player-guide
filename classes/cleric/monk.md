Monks are a following of clerics who prefer to fight hand to hand, having made their bodies into lethal weapons from many years of training. They are masters of discipline and self-control and can tolerate any amount of pain with minimal discomfort. They can cast cleric spells and are proficient at both fighting and healing.
