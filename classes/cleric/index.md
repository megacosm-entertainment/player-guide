The cleric leads a way of life suited more to defense and healing rather than brute force or offensive magic. They wield as much power as mages; however, the nature of this power comes from their unique ability to channel the power of the gods. This ability comes from their indomitable spirit, daily meditation, and self-sacrifice to achieve a greater state of being. Indeed, Clerics are perhaps the most disciplined of all ways of life, for their struggle comes in matters of the soul and spirit, not just physical fitness.
