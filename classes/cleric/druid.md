A druid is a cleric who is very in touch with nature and can channel its powers. Druids are generally more comfortable in the serenity of a forest rather than a dungeon but they can call on their magic anywhere.  They regenerate their power much faster in areas they feel more at home.  They can fight fiercely if necessary, but prefer to work in peace with the harmony of nature.
