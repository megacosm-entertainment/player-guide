Rangers are a small sect of clerics who feel most at comfort in the company of nature.  They often make a living in the wilderness as guides, knowing the ins and outs of deep forests as if they were the streets of their hometowns.  They have a particularly sharp knack for locating exactly where they are in the wilderness from inspection of nearby landmarks, and never get lost.
