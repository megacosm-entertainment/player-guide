Adepts are masters in the skill of fighting evil.  They are often recruited for exorcism duties as well as full-scale wars on the servants of darkness.  Undead creatures tremble at the mention of an Adept, as the exquisite pain these holy clerics can inflict can be matched by none other than a god.
