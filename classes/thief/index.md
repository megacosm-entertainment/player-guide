Thieves are masters of deftness and cunning above all other classes. They base their skills on the ability to avoid a fight of brute force because they will almost certainly lose. Instead, thieves lurk and  hide in the shadows, light of foot, treading the darkness; none can surpass their range of unique skills or think faster in a pinch.
