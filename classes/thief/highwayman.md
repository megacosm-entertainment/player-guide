The Highwaymen are a set of thieves who dedicate their lives to being the best at what they do.  They live on the road, stealing from both the good and evil, and are masters of disguise and deception.  They have no qualms with putting any skill to use if it helps them steal and plunder and will resort to violence if necesarry.  Their stealth is bested only by the Ninja.
