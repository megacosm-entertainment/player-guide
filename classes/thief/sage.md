The Sages of Sentience are some of the wisest thieves in existence, not only knowing every trick in the book but knowing how to evade them.  They have extensive knowledge of creatures as well as an uncanny perception of character, being able to tell someone's true intentions simply by looking at them.  They have risen above the level of petty thievery and are commonly employed as high advisors in royal courts as they know more about thief tactics than anyone else alive.
