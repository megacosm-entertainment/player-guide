Rogues have no real devotion, and are not necesarrily evil although they are not the most moral of characters. They prefer to use their cunning and tend to avoid killing somebody unless necesarry; they are not entirely objected to the latter, either. They are very skilled at pilfering and work under cover of night and silence.
