The Ninja are a class of thieves whose life is dedicated to stealth and deadliness.  They train from sunrise to sunset and are the most fierce, crafty fighters in existence, ready to kill as many opponents as possible if cornered.  However, it is rarely necesarry for the Ninja can choose to only be seen when wanted, and can sneak into a heavily guarded castle without waking so much as a rat.
